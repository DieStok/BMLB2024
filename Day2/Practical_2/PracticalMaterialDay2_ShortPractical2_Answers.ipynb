    "## Regularisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularisation is a method of automatically constraining how much your model can (over)fit on the training data. We add some factor (regularisation weight $\\lambda$) times the sum of squares of the parameter (excluding the intercept ($\\theta_0$) to the cost function. In this way, the model cannot pick extremely large values for the parameters, i.e. when you have 100 features, the model is forced to only have high $\\theta$ parameters for those features that matter a lot for correct classification, while having extremely low or even 0 values for features that don't. Hence, regularisation also automatically selects features that are of importance to your problem: _feature selection_! (Strictly speaking, this holds only for when you penalise the absolute of the sum of the parameters, not when you penalise the square). Note that once you have trained the model and want to know the cost on the validation/test set, you should not use regularised cost: you care about your performance in the end (which you hope is better because you constrain the parameters during fitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "* To get started, change your costFuncLogReg to have an extra argument `lambda_ = 0` ( _ because lambda is a keword for anonymous functions), that, if set to a value higher than 0, causes regularisation to be performed.\n",
    "* Make sure to exclude the bias/intercept term ($\\theta_0$) from this. By convention this is not regularised.\n",
    "* While you are at it, also reorder the arguments to `thetas, x, y, lambda_=0` so it is easier to use BFGS or another optimizer if we want to!\n",

    "\n",
    "* Replace the 0 values with `np.nan` (**Note**: be aware that you shouldn't do this for all columns. Think about it.)\n",
    "* Use [sklearn.impute.KNNImputer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.KNNImputer.html) to impute values that are missing for those columns where you inserted NaNs. Those who have followed the BiBC Essentials Course might remember K-Nearest Neighbour clustering. This function determines the (by default) 5 most similar samples (based on data that is _not_ missing) and sets the bmi/glucose level, etc. to the mean of their values. Euclidean distance is used. We will discuss K-Nearest Neighbour clustering in two days. For now, you can just use it. To do so, use `a = KNNImputer(missing_values = np.nan)` followed by `imputedData = a.fit_transform(nonImputedData)`.\n",
    "* Note that this turns the DataFrame into a numpy array: this is not a problem but it's good to know.\n",
    "* Mean-normalise (i.e. subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) the features using the function provided below. This should be done on all the data except the labels.\n",
    "* Put the class into a `np.array` (a column vector) called `diabetesClassLabels`"

    "Okay, now we can train regularised logistic regression on this data. Let's **use lambda values of 0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 100, and 1000**. We'll downsample the data so we have equal amounts of the positive and negative class, and train the classifier on 80% of the training data while testing on 20% held-out data (normally we'd use cross-validation but let's not put that extra level of complication in here as well). \n",

    "The visualisation of a decision boundary/what has been learned is somewhat complex: we can't just draw some boundary in 2D as our data isn't 2D but 8D.\n",
    "We'll reduce the dimensionality to two dimensions using PCA, and then show in those two dimensions which points are positive or negative for diabetes, and what the classifier predicts everywhere in that plane. This is done for you. We'll talk about dimensionality reduction on the last day of this week. For now, know that, by its nature, dimensionality reduction will lose some of the true differences in your data, so visualisation of the decision boundary in this 2D space is bound to be an approximation, and cannot capture completely what your classifier is doing (as it's separating things in 8 dimensions rather than 2)! \n",

You'll probably also need `np.ravel(diabetesClassLabels)` and `np.where()`. <br> Save the new data as `equalClassSizeDiabetesData` and `equalClassSizeClassLabels` for the labels.\n",

    "If all goes well, you will see that the cost on the test set is lowest when using $\\lambda = 0$. Isn't that grand!? I had chosen a seed where it seemed to improve matters, but of course: same seed, different year: different outcome. Apparently, regularisation here is not too important. You see that cost rises as lambda goes up, and that theta values go down, as you would expect.  Spectacularly unconvincing example notwithstanding: in general, for unregularised classification, you run the risk of tuning the parameters _too specifically_ to the values in the training set, which increases the cost on the unseen test set. Regularisation guards against this by penalising too large parameters."

    "We've talked in the lectures about the performance of a classification algorithm. We want to know the true positive rate and false positive rates for a given threshold, but also the classifier's performance over a range of thresholds. It is not too difficult to make a ROC curve yourself. Let's do that now for the best classifier (with the lowest mean cost on the test set).\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to you to:\n",
    "* Make a range of 200 thresholds (from 1 to 0) for saying something is the positive set (use `np.linspace` for this).\n",
    "* Make two empty lists: `truePositiveRates` and `trueNegativeRates`.\n",
    "* Make predictions on the `testDataDiabetes` using the best set of learned thetas (which you can manually select or get from `finalThetas` using the index of the minimum element in `testSetCostList`).\n",
    "* Make a for loop over the different thresholds you defined. Within that loop:\n",
    "    * Turn the predictions into class labels using `np.where` and the current threshold value.\n",
    "    * Calculate the true positive rate (sensitivity/recall) and append it to the list.\n",
    "    * Calculate the true negative rate and append it to the `trueNegativeRates` list.\n",
    "* Finally make a plot of the sensitivity (true positive rate) on the y-axis and 1-specificity (1-TNR) on the x-axis. (use `fig, ax = plt.subplots()` and `ax.plot()`). Don't forget to set the axis labels and a title!\n",

    "## What I'd like you to remember here:\n",
    "* What regularisation is, and how it works (penalising large weights for parameters, thereby forcing the algorithm to focus on those that really give it a lot of _bang for its buck_ and decreasing overfitting)\n",
    "* How to implement regularisation, and how the parameter $\\lambda$ affects it\n",
    "* How to do some basic cleaning on a dataset, and what _the idea_ of imputation is (specifically of a KNNImputer)\n",
    "* How to make a ROC plot, and what exactly is depicted on it, as well as why we might want to compare something like ROC AUC between classifiers, rather than accuracy. Note also that ROC AUC also compares wholly unrealistic thresholds (we would never use a threshold where we just say that everyone is positive or negative, say), so more clever comparison metrics exist. Note also that the ROC AUC does not, in and of itself, say much about out-of-domain generalisation, which might be most important in the real world!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final words\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations. You've implemented regularised logistic regression on a real dataset (that you cleaned up yourself) and made your own ROC curve. We'll now move on to multiclass logistic regression and then to neural networks!\n",
